  <p>Creates a new package for the selected BuildMaster application and sets the BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER environment variable.<p>
  
  <p>The choice of using the build step or post build action to trigger a BuildMaster build will be largely dependent on how you import the build artifacts into BuildMaster:  
	  <ol type="a">  
		  <li>You are using the BuildMaster Jenkins Build Importer Build Step which imports build artifacts from Jenkins: the post build action is required.</li>
		  
		  <li>You are using a standard BuildMaster build step and importing files from a folder that you've placed the artifacts into from the Jenkins build 
		  (eg using <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ArtifactDeployer+Plugin">ArtifactDeployer Plugin</a>): either the post build or build step actions will be fine.</li>
		  
		  <li>You use an external artifact repository such as Nexus, Artifactory or ProGet: either the post build or build step actions will be fine.</li>
	  </ol>
  </p> 
    
  <p>
    If you have multiple Jenkins jobs all triggering a build for the same BuildMaster application check out the "Enable Deployable in BuildMaster" and "Copy Previous Package's Variables"
    options as a means to ensure that the new BuildMaster build picks up artifacts from only the Jenkins jobs that have build for its release.
