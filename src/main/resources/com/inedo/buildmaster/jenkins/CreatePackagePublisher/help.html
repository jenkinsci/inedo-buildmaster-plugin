  <p>Creates a new build for the selected BuildMaster application and sets the BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER environment variable.</p>
  
  <p>The choice of using the build step or post build action to trigger a BuildMaster build will be largely dependent on how you import the build artifacts into BuildMaster:  
	  <ol type="a">  
		  <li>You are using the BuildMaster Jenkins Build Importer Build Step which imports build artifacts from Jenkins: the post build action is required.</li>
		  
		  <li>You are using a standard BuildMaster build step and importing files from a folder that you've placed the artifacts into from the Jenkins build 
		  (eg using <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ArtifactDeployer+Plugin">ArtifactDeployer Plugin</a>): either the post build or build step actions will be fine.</li>
		  
		  <li>You use an external artifact repository such as Nexus, Artifactory or ProGet: either the post build or build step actions will be fine.</li>
	  </ol>
