<div>
  <p>Select the BuildMaster release to trigger build for:  
  <ul>
  	<li>Latest Active Release: will automatically get the latest active release number from BuildMaster for the selected application</li>
  	<li><i>[Release Number]</i>: alternatively select a specific release number from the list of active releases supplied for the selected application</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>During a build the BUILDMASTER_RELEASE_NUMBER environment variable will be set with this value.</p>
  
  <p>NOTE: if a specific release number is selected (for example an emergency patch might want to go on an earlier release than the latest one) this will 
  become invalid once the release is finalised in BuildMaster.  There may be scope for an enhancement here to provide alternative forms of matching on release number - eg by
  branch name.</p>
