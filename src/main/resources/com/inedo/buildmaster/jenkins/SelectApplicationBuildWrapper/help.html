<div>
    <p>Obtains the Release and Build numbers for the selected BuildMaster application from BuildMaster and injects the following environment
        variables into the build job:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>BUILDMASTER_APPLICATION_ID</li>
        <li>BUILDMASTER_APPLICATION_NAME</li>
        <li>BUILDMASTER_RELEASE_NUMBER</li>
        <li>BUILDMASTER_LATEST_BUILD_NUMBER</li>
        <li>BUILDMASTER_NEXT_BUILD_NUMBER</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you do not use these values in your build steps there is no requirement to use this task.</p>

    <p><i>Note: If you have multiple jobs all triggering builds on the same BuildMaster application this task will queue those jobs so that you cannot get two jobs
        triggering a build at the same time.</i></p>

    <p>When used within pipeline script this wraps a block and injects the above variables. Note that the applicationId parameter can contain either the id or name of a
        BuildMaster application.</p>
