<div>
  <p>The build number that BuildMaster should use for the build. If the field is empty then assumes the "Select BuildMaster Application" action has been used 
  to provide the value and will look this up using the expression "${BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER}".</p>
  
  <p>If the variable is not populated, or has a value BUILDMASTER, then BuildMaster will use it's own PackageNumber - the BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER will be 
  set to the actual BuildMaster build number used in this instance.</p>
  
  <p>If supplying a build number to BuildMaster the build will fail with a BadRequest exception if an attempt is made to reuse a build number from a 
  previous build.  If this happens you will need to update the Jenkins build number to something greater than the latest BuildMaster build - there is a
  plugin to help with that: <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Next+Build+Number+Plugin">Next Build Number Plugin</a>.</p>
  
  <p>This setting would only be altered if not using the "Select BuildMaster Application" action.</p>
