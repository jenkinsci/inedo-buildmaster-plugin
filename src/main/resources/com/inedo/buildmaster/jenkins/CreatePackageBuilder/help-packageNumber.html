<div>
  <p>The number that BuildMaster should use for the build.  Defaults to the BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER variable populated by the 
  "Select BuildMaster Application" action. Leave the field blank to have BuildMaster use it's own BuildNumber - the BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER will be 
  set to the actual BuildMaster build number used in this instance.</p>
  
  <p>If supplying a build number to BuildMaster and the build will fail with a BadRequest exception if an attempt is made to reuse a build number from a 
  previous build.  If this happens you will need to update the Jenkins build number to something greater than the latest BuildMaster build - there is a
  plugin to help with that: <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Next+Build+Number+Plugin">Next Build Number Plugin</a>.</p>
  
  <p>NOTE: to retain backwards compatibility BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER has not been updated to reflect the new naming standard from BuildMaster - this may change in a future release</p>
