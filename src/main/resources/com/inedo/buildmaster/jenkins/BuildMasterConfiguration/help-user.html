<div>
  The user name of a user that has the necessary rights in BuildMaster to perform the actions you will be requesting.
  If this is a NTLM domain user you may need to provide the name in the format 'DOMAIN\\user'.  
  <br/>
  The username and password are only required to get the execution logs from BuildMaster on a deployment failure. If you do not configure the tasks to print logs on error then there is no need to set this value.
</div>
