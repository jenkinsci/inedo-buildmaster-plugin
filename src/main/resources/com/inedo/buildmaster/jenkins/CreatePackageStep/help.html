<div>
  <p>Creates a new package for the selected BuildMaster application and sets the BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER script and environment variables.<p>
  
  <p>Unlike the FreeStyle plugins, this script plugin can be used for both build and post build actions.
     The choice of executing this plugin as a build step or post build action will be largely dependent on how you import the build artifacts into BuildMaster:  
	  <ol type="a">  
		  <li>You are using the BuildMaster Jenkins Build Importer Build Step which imports build artifacts from Jenkins: the post build action is required.</li>
		  
		  <li>You are using a standard BuildMaster build step and importing files from a folder that you've placed the artifacts into from the Jenkins build 
		  (eg using <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ArtifactDeployer+Plugin">ArtifactDeployer Plugin</a>): either the post build or build step actions will be fine.</li>
		  
		  <li>You use an external artifact repository such as Nexus, Artifactory or ProGet: either the post build or build step actions will be fine.</li>
	  </ol>
  </p> 

  <p>
    If you have multiple Jenkins jobs all triggering a build for the same BuildMaster application check out the "Enable Deployable in BuildMaster" and "Copy Previous Package's Variables"
    options as a means to ensure that the new BuildMaster build picks up artifacts from only the Jenkins jobs that have build for its release. 
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Note</b> that pipeline steps are unable to set variables directly so must be called in this format:</p>
  <div style="margin-left:40px;"><code>BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER = buildMasterCreatePackage(applicationId: '${BUILDMASTER_APPLICATION_ID}', packageNumber: '${BUILDMASTER_PACKAGE_NUMBER}', releaseNumber: '${BUILDMASTER_RELEASE_NUMBER}', deployToFirstStage: true, waitTillBuildCompleted: [printLogOnFailure: true])</code></div>
   
</div>
