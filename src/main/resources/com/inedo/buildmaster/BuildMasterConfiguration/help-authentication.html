  <p>Authentication should not be required, however I have found that Active Directory based user accounts can get locked out if the user is not authenticated properly.</p>
  
  <p>Select one of:
	  <ul>
		  <li>None: no authentication</li>
		  <li>Basic: user name and password</li>
		  <li>NTLM: for Microsoft Windows platforms that includes Windows specific attributes such as name of the domain the user belongs to</li>
	  </ul>
  </p>
