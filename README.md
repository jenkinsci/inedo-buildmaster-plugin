# inedo-buildmaster-plugin
Allows Jenkins to request version information and trigger a build on an application in BuildMaster (http://inedo.com/buildmaster) as part of a Jenkins build process.

## Building The Plugin
-------------------

The plugin is built using <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">Gradle</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gradle+JPI+Plugin">Gradle Jenkins JPI Plugin</a>.  The code base includes the Gradle Wrapper, which will automatically download the correct version of Gradle. 

Gradle can be run from the command line or from your IDE:

Command line
============
From the command line, `cd` to the folder containing a copy of this project, and run 

  `./gradlew clean jpi` on Unix-based systems, or 
  
  `gradlew clean jpi` on Windows.
  
  `gradlew -Dhttp.proxyHost=yourProxy -Dhttp.proxyPort=yourPort -Dhttp.proxyUser=yourUsername -Dhttp.proxyPassword=yourPassword -Dhttps.proxyHost=yourProxy -Dhttps.proxyPort=yourPort -Dhttps.proxyUser=yourUsername -Dhttps.proxyPassword=yourPassword clean jpi` from behind a proxy.It is vital that any tasks come after the proxy configuration. 

This will download the required dependencies, clean the existing project, recompile all source code and build the jpi file required by jenkins. 

IDE
===
For Eclipse and NetBeans, you will need to install a Gradle plugin to your IDE before importing the project. See [Gradle tooling](https://www.gradle.org/tooling) for details.

On importing the project to your IDE, the required dependencies will be downloaded.

## Developing The Plugin
-------------------

To spin up a Jenkins instance with this plugin installed for manual testing, run `gradlew clean server` (see "building the plugin" above). The Jenkins instance will be available on port 8080 on your localhost.

# Usage
The plugin has a lot of help that you can access while using Jenkins, but as a brief overview:

## Global Configuratiuon
Before using the plugin in a job you will need to go to the global configurn section at configure how the plugin will find your BuildMaster instance.

## Select BuildMaster Application
Within your Job optionally add a build step to select the BuildMaster application and set the release number and build number that you wish to trigger the build for.

## Trigger Build
Add the trigger build step.  If you haven't used the "Select BuildMaster Application" action then you will need to go into the advanced section and set the application id, release and build number details.
